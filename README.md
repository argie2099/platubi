## How I worked on this project

My goal was to build something useful for people that own cryptocurrencies.

 - I built this web app from a design made by me. [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/sOsL9kBkhNnoFDfTcpyVAg/Platubi?node-id=801%3A973)



## What is Platubi

I invite you to check [Platubi](https://platubi.com) online.

Platubi is a free website useful for checking the sum of all the currencies and cryptos you registered, you dont have to pay or fund nothing, it's just a calculator.


For example, let's say I add AS A NOTE a register that says USD 500 and another one containing EUR 200.
And let's say I choose to visualize all my money in a single currency: USD.
The platform is going to make all of the calculations for you and show you the value of USD 500 + EUR 200 = 735 USD.
It also works with cryptos and with literally every currency in the world.
